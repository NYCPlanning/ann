<h3>NumFloors 2020-03</h3>

<p>Here I compared PLUTO's NumFloors field to a derived number of floors from building footprints.
We derived the number of floors by dividing the heightroof field by 10 or 12 feet, depending on the land use code assigned to the lot.</p>

<p>After filtering the results using a certain threshold of error, I verified the correct number  of floors using CycloMedia, Google Maps, or other online sources of information.</p>

<p>Corrections were submitted through the manual corrections file. This should resolve the most
egregious errors presently seen in this field.</p>
