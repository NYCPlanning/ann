<p>This was an effort to determine how often the number of buildings on a lot differs between PLUTO
(derived from GeoSupport) and building footprints, and how often one or the other is correct.</p>

<p>There is SQL here to group the buildings from building footprints by lot, and compare that
result to NumBldgs. I verified the correct source using ZoLa, Google Maps, and CycloMedia.</p>

<h4>What You Need</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>PLUTO.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building Footprints</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Nice but not necessary</h4>
<ol>
<li>Domain tables of LandUse and BldgClass Code definitions.</li>
</ol>
