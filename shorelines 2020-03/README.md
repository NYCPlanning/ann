<h3>Shoreline Replacement File Assessment 2020-03</h3>

<p>There are two versions of MapPLUTO: Water Included and Clipped to Shoreline. To create the clipped version,
we currently clip the water included version to a shoreline file provided by the DOF.</p>

<p>Here I looked at the impact of replacing the DOF shoreline file with either a LIDAR file or CSCL borders.
The idea was to assess the overall land area and see if would be larger or smaller if different borders are used.</p>

<p>I am also looking at the LandUse code to determine what the new breakout of area would be by land use.</p>

<h4>What You Need to Reproduce this Research</h4>

<ol>
<li>MapPLUTO, water included</li>
<li>MapPLUTO, clipped to shoreline</li>
<li>LIDAR shoreline file</li>
<li>CSCL shoreline file</li>
</ol>

<h4>Nice but not necessary</h4>
