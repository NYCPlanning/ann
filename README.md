# db-pluto-research
PLUTO research projects, ad-hoc reports, etc.

This is a repository geared specifically to research, as opposed to development, projects.

It should contain files pertaining to research, including SQL statements, Python scripts, .MXD ArcMap files, and shapefiles.

These research projects are mainly QA/QC projects and investigations into potential enhancements to PLUTO.

Each project should be organized into its own folder named after the PLUTO field in question plus the date of the work done.
